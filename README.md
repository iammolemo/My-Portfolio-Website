# My-Portfolio-Website

Introduction:
This document aims at describing about a portfolio website developed by an IT final year student with the intention of presenting his/her working skills, educational projects, and Computer Science profile. For this particular project, it covers the technologies employed (such as programming languages and frameworks, etc.), features incorporated into the plan and framework, as well as the strategies that were involved in the process of development. 

Objectives:
• To create my own website which, in turn, will effectively market my strengths and skills. 
• The purpose of the portfolio is to allow the potential clients and employers to have an easy time while going through some of the work samples I have done. 
• To demonstrate a clean and user-friendly look /feel which may effectively demonstrate my IT skills and aesthetic touch. 

Project Overview:
It is an online collection of some of my works as a software developer since the portfolio website aims to sell my skills and expertise as an Junior Software Developer. It is devised to focus on relevant projects, technical competencies, as well as varsity career experience. The layout of the website is sleek and contemporary, thus the ability to respond to the various gadgets and their screen resolutions. 

Technologies I Used:
The website is built using the following technologies: 
HTML: Regarding the structure and filling of the webpage. 
CSS3: For presentation purpose for example use in styling cells and layouts and aspects such as responsiveness. 
JavaScript: It is used for interactive material and contents that changes every now and then. Remixicons and Boxicons: To help in infographics and adding images. 
Google Fonts: This abbreviation was created to denote custom typography. 
Typed. js: Generates impressive and interactive typing effects which is customizable for the text. 
Scrollreveal. js: Makes animations that make elements appear on the web pages as the users scrolls through the page. 
Smtp. js: Allows the implementation of the client side to be able to send mails with the use of the SMTP protocol. 
Sweetalert2: This is a tool that is used to create alert and confirmation dialogs for the web pages and one can customize it.

Features Used and Website Functionality:
Home Page and Header: Include A navigator bar which has: Home, About, Skills and Services, Projects and Contact tabs. Along with that are 2 buttons: one of them helps to download and get access to my CV. The home page also has as well as links to my social media profiles. 
About Section: Gives brief details about my personal details, education, professional strength and working experience. 
Skills and Services: A list of some of the skills that I have acquired during my varsity carrier, for instance, the programming languages, frameworks, and other software I have a working knowledge of and features the services that I offer accompanied by a brief description of what I can offer. 
Projects Section: This section consists of my key projects, some of the built projects are with the help of team members during my varsity career, while some have been built by me individually. These projects come with their brief descriptions as well as direct website links or their project repositories. 
Contact Section: It features a contact form where the potential clients/employers can get in touch with me by filling in some of their personal details, accompanied by the messages they’d like to send me.

Project Details:
Project Cards: Every project is presented in a form of a card with the short description and direct links to the sites(serving as a live demo), or repositories. (key technologies and software used can be found as a part of my skills, specified in the skills section) 
Interactive Elements: JavaScript and CSS were used in the purpose of improving interactivity like; graphics animation and content loading.

Usability :
Navigation: This was followed by adding a sticky navigation to enhance on-site user experience & to give them an easy access to the sections. 
Accessibility: Laid down accessibilities that were in conformity with laid down guidelines. 

Code Structure:
• HTML 
INDEX. html: The website, or the information structure of a specific site, is defined in the main HTML document. 
• CSS 
STYLES. CSS: Prime stylesheet used in the description of the website. 
• JavaScript 
script. js: Holds script related to interactions and modifying the contents dynamically using JavaScript. 

Challenges and Solutions:
Challenge 1: Responsive Design 
Issue: Making sure that the given website appeared appropriate when viewed on any device. This one was somewhat challenging for me to be quite honest. 
Solution: Used some JavaScript on styles to further customize for the other devices and the various screen sizes. here you can find information about me, my hobbies, and contacts to my social media accounts. As much as I can I tried to correct it. Functionality is not bad in the mobile devices, but I would however recommend one to open it from a PC for better functionality.
Challenge 2: Cross-Browser Compatibility
Issue: Consistency across various browsers.
Solution: Tested the website in multiple browsers and adjusted CSS as needed to address inconsistencies.


Changes I would like to make in future:
Some of the improvements I wish to make in the future concern the following: 
Enhanced Interactivity: Other items that should be contained in the rich media should be aspects such as delivering animations or the implementation of the animated rolling of projects. 
Blog Section: Such supplements as blog or article with information on the current active projects can be introduced. 
SEO Optimization: The SEO features should be optimised to have a better rank on the search engines. 
Screen resolutions: Make the website to be friendly this means that the format of the website should adjust to any screen size.

Conclusion: 
This portfolio was rather effective in the sense that it helped in the acquisition of real skills in web development as well as the improvement of existing skills. Honestly it has been so hard all through the project; it took me so many hours until it was done but I treasure what I have learnt and skills I have developed throughout this project and would not swap it for anything else. 

In totality, this project can confirm that I am capable of designing a website that fits its function as well as complement that function, is beautiful to look at and easy to operate. This portfolio shall be augmented periodically, in the process documenting all the developmental, and achievements as it relates to the software developments.
